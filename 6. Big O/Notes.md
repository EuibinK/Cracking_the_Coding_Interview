# VI. Big O

**Big O** - metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms

#### 

## Time Complexity

: ~(asymptotic runtime, or big O time)



### **Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega**

- **O (Big O)** - upper bound on the time
  - e.g. an algorithm that prints all the values in an array - O(N), O(N^2)... etc
- **∆ (Big Omega)** - lower bound
  - e.g. an algorithm that prints all the values in an array - ∆(N), ∆(log N)... etc

- **θ (Big Theta)** - both O and ∆ - tight bound
  - " - θ(N)

  **Tip** - in industry, big O is closer to what academics mean by θ.

​         - try to offer the tightest description of the runtime



### Best Case, Worst Case, and Expected Case

: Let's think of a quick so
